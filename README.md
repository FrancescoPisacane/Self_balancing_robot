# Self_balancing_robot
An Arduino-based self-balancing robot built using an MPU6050 gyro/accelerometer and L298N motor driver. This project leverages PID control to keep the robot upright by adjusting motor speed and direction based on tilt angle. Ideal for learning control systems and robotics fundamentals.
